# DexDP3
This repository is for the thesis **Dexterous Manipulation on Multi-Fingered Hands Based on 3D Diffusion Policy**.

**3D Diffusion Policy (DP3)**, a novel generative framework for robotic behavior synthesis utilizing 3D point clouds as input. The framework is implemented on the Franka Panda robotic arm and the Allegro dexterous hand.  

## Features  

- **Teleoperation System for Dataset Collection**:  
  - Wrist tracking using the OptiTrack V120:Trio.  
  - Finger motion capture with Manus Quantum Mocap Metagloves.  

- **Unified ROS Workspace**:  
  - Seamless integration of robotic arm and dexterous hand control.  
  - Teleoperation workflows and policy deployment.  

- **Simulation and Real-World Validation**:  
  - Realistic models and environments constructed with MoveIt for safe data collection and deployment.  
  - Policy performance validated on the Franka Panda robotic arm and Allegro dexterous hand.  

## Results  

The **3D Diffusion Policy** demonstrates effective performance in advanced robotic manipulation tasks.
